# Rubik Cube - AI project


To run the project there are 2 options:
1. run in the printed version (recommended)
2. run the GUI version.

to change the size of the cube, change the "cube_size" parameters in cube_utils.py to 
the chosen size. default is 3.

## option 1: printed version:
In cube_solve_ida.py file, run the "run_without_gui(number_of_scrambles=6, from_file=None)"  function.

you can change the number_of_scrambles for the cube. this function create scrambled cube, and than solve
the cube by thr different methods: IDA* with several heuristics, reinforcement learning, group theory.
all the relevant data and the comparison between the methods will be printed on the screen.

Have fun! 


## option 2: GUI
run the cube_interactive.py file
press "create cube" button to scramble the cube.
press "solve cube" button to solve the cube using IDA.

##### Important note 1
In order to run the GUI properly,
the project must be run through the debugger with a debugging point in the file "cube_interactive",
inside the function "_create_problem_cube" (in the first row).
##### Important note 2
the 4*4 cube solved only by the printed version.
