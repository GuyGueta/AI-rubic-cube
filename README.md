# Rubik Cube - AI project

To run the project, run the cube_interactive file.
press "create cube" button to scramble the cube.
press "solve cube" button to solve the cube using IDA.

## Important note
Right now, in order to run the GUI properly,
the project must be run through the debugger with a debugging point in the file "cube_interactive",
inside the function "_create_problem_cube" (in the first row).
